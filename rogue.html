		<div class="expertise rogueFeatureSection">
				<h2>Expertise</h2>
				At 1st level, choose two of your skill proficiencies, 
				or one of your skill proficiencies and your proficiency 
				witd thieves' tools. Your proficiency bonus is doubled for 
				any ability check you make that uses either of the chosen proficiencies.
				</br></br>

				(in skills or witd tdieves' tools) to gain tdis benefit.
			</div>
			
			<div class="sneakAttack rogueFeatureSection">
				<h2>Sneak Attack</h2>
				Beginning at 1st level, you know how to strike subtly and exploit 
				a foe's distraction. Once per turn, you can deal an extra 1d6 damage
				to one creature you hit with an attack if you have advantage on the 
				attack roll. The attack must use a finesse or a ranged weapon.</br></br>
				You don't need advantage on the attack roll if another enemy of the 
				target is within 5 feet of it, that enemy isn't incapacitated, and you 
				don't have disadvantage on the attack roll.</br></br>
				The amount of extra damage increases as you gain levels in this 
				class, as shown in the d6 column of the Rogue table.
			</div>
			
			<div class="thievesCant rogueFeatureSection">
				<h2>Thieve's Cant</h2>
				During your rogue training you learned thieves' cant, a secret mix of 
				dialect, jargon, and code that allows you to hide messages in seemingly 
				normal conversation. Only another creature that knows thieves' cant 
				understands such messages. It takes four times longer to convey such a 
				message than it does to speak the same idea plainly.
				<br/><br/>
				In addition, you understand a set of secret signs and symbols used to 
				convey short, simple messages, such as whether an area is dangerous or 
				the territory of a thieves' guild, whether loot is nearby, or whether the 
				people in an area are easy marks or will provide a safe house for 
				thieves on the run.
			</div>
			
			<div class="cunningAction rogueFeatureSection">
				<h2>Cunning Action</h2>
				Starting at 2nd level, your quick thinking and agility allow you to 
				move and act quickly. You can take a bonus action on each of your turns 
				in combat. This action can be used only to take the Dash, Disengage, 
				or Hide action.
			</div>
			
			<div class="roguishArchetype rogueFeatureSection">
				<h2>Roguish Archetype</h2>
				At 3rd level, you choose an archetype that you emulate in the exercise 
				of your rogue abilities. Your archetype choice grants you features at 
				3rd level and then again at 9th, 13th, and 17th level.
			</div>
			
			<div class="steadyAim rogueFeatureSection">
				<h2>Steady Aim</h2>
				At 3rd level, as a bonus action, you give yourself advantage on your next 
				attack roll on the current turn. You can use this bonus action only if you 
				haven't moved during this turn, and after you use the bonus action, your 
				speed is 0 until the end of the current turn.
			</div>
			
			<div class="ab-scoreImprov rogueFeatureSection">
				<h2>Ability Score Improvement</h2>
				When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 10th, 12th, 16th, and 19th 
				level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you 
				can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't 
				increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.
			</div>
			
			<div class="uncannyDodge rogueFeatureSection">
				<h2>Uncanny Dodge</h2>
				Starting at 5th level, when an attacker that you can see hits you with 
				an attack, you can use your reaction to 
				halve the attack's damage against you.
			</div>
			
			<div class="evasion rogueFeatureSection">
				<h2>Evasion</h2>
				Beginning at 7th level, you can nimbly dodge out of the way of 
				certain area effects, such as a red dragon's fiery breath or an Ice 
				Storm spell. When you are subjected to an effect that allows you to 
				make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, you instead 
				take no damage if you succeed on the saving throw, and only half 
				damage if you fail.
			</div>
			
			<div class="reliableTalent rogueFeatureSection">
				<h2>Reliable Talent</h2>
				By 11th level, you have refined your chosen skills until they 
				approach perfection. Whenever you make an ability check that lets 
				you add your proficiency bonus, you can treat a d20 roll of 9 or 
				lower as a 10.
			</div>
			
			<div class="blindSense rogueFeatureSection">
				<h2>Blindsense</h2>
				Starting at 14th level, if you are able to hear, you are aware of the 
				location of any hidden or invisible creature within 10 feet of you.
			</div>
			
			<div class="slipperyMind rogueFeatureSection">
				<h2>Slippery Mind</h2>
				By 15th level, you have acquired greater mental strength. 
				You gain proficiency in Wisdom saving throws.
			</div>
			
			<div class="elusive rogueFeatureSection">
				<h2>Elusive</h2>
				By 15th level, you have acquired greater mental strength. You gain 
				proficiency in Wisdom saving throws.
			</div>
			<div class="strokeOfLuck rogueFeatureSection">
				<h2>Stroke of Luck</h2>
				At 20th level, you have an uncanny knack for succeeding when you need to. 
				If your attack misses a target within range, you can turn the miss into a 
				hit. Alternatively, if you fail an ability check, you can treat the d20 
				roll as a 20.
				<br/></br>
				Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.
