    <div id="race-info">
      Born of dragons, as their name proclaims, the dragonborn walk proudly
      through a world that greets them with fearful incomprehension. Shaped by
      draconic gods or the dragons themselves, dragonborn originally hatched
      from dragon eggs as a unique race, combining the best attributes of
      dragons and humanoids. Some dragonborn are faithful servants to true
      dragons, others form the ranks of soldiers in great wars, and still others
      find themselves adrift, with no clear calling in life.

        <h3>Draconic Ancestry</h3>
        <p>
          You are distantly related to a particular kind of dragon. Choose a
          type of dragon from the below list; this determines the damage and
          area of your breath weapon, and the type of resistance you gain.

      <div class="breath-weapon">
        <h3>Breath Weapon</h3>
        <p>
          You can use your action to exhale destructive energy. It deals damage
          in an area according to your ancestry. When you use your breath
          weapon, all creatures in the area must make a saving throw, the type
          of which is determined by your ancestry. The DC of this saving throw
          is 8 + your Constitution modifier + your proficiency bonus. A creature
          takes 2d6 damage on a failed save, and half as much damage on a
          successful one. The damage increase to 3d6 at 6th level, 4d6 at 11th,
          and 5d6 at 16th level. After using your breath weapon, you cannot use
          it again until you complete a short or long rest. HBInstead, you may
          use your breath weapon a number of times equal to your Constitution
          modifier. You regain expended uses on a short or long rest.
