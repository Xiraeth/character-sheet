# Dungeons & Dragons 5e Character Sheet
My portable, mobile phone character sheet  
It uses local storage to keep track of everything, since it's not a lot of data.  
So far it does not utilize any database, it's purely client-side, but it does the job.  
Almost everything is editable, except for the spells list, which is under construction.
