# Dungeons & Dragons 5e Character Sheet
My portable, mobile phone character sheet (right now it's only tailored for Paladins, since my character was a Paladin).  
It uses local storage to keep track of everything, since it's not a lot of data.  
Almost everything in the index.html file is editable (except for the skill modifiers, since they are calculated automatically). The class and race files are not, since the text there is pretty standard and can be generated dynamically in the future.  
Click on a skill/saving throw to toggle it from the proficiency list.
