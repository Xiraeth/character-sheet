# Dungeons & Dragons 5e Character Sheet
My portable, mobile phone character sheet.  
It uses local storage to keep track of everything, since it's not a lot of data.  
So far it does not utilize any database, it's purely client-side, but it does the job.  
Everything in the index.html file is editable (except for the skill modifiers, since they are calculated automatically). The rest of the files are not, since the text there is pretty standard and can be generated dynamically in the future.  
Click on a skill/saving throw to toggle it from the proficiencies list.
